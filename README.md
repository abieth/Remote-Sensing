# Remote Sensing
Remote Sensing is the name of the remote sensing project that is developed with Python inspired by ENVI (software developed by L3Harris Geospatial)<br>
Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets.<br>
Due to my personal interest in applying modern technologies in daily work, I decided to create this repository for the remote sensing repository<br>
In this Repository you will see several folders, and each folder is about specefic topic. <br>
It is better to introduce folders immediately without wasting time, SO....<br>
