# Remote Sensing
Remote Sensing is the name of the remote sensing project that is developed with Python inspired by ENVI (software developed by L3Harris Geospatial)<br>
Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets.<br>
Due to my personal interest in applying modern technologies in daily work, I decided to create this repository for the remote sensing repository<br>
In this Repository you will see several folders, and each folder is about specefic topic. <br>
It is better to introduce folders immediately without wasting time, SO....<br>

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a regularized type of feed-forward neural network that learns feature engineering by itself via filters optimization. Vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, seen during backpropagation in earlier neural networks, are prevented by using regularized weights over fewer connections. Hear I used my CNN model for lithology classification on my Sentinel-2 satellite image and my Ground truth data.
