# ImageEnhancement
Image enhancement is the process of making an image more interpret-able for a particular application (Faust, 1989). Enhancement makes important features of raw, remotely sensed data more interpret-able to the human eye. In this repository I've tried different methods of Image enhancement (e.g. Gamma, Logarithm, Sigmoid function and etc.)
